# Voltage Divider Experiment

## Goal
Understand how a voltage divider behaves with and without load.

## Circuit
Two 1kΩ resistors connected in series with a 9V supply.

## Components
- R1 = 1kΩ
- R2 = 1kΩ
- Vin = 9V

## Theory
Vout = Vin × (R2 / (R1 + R2))

Expected Vout (no load): 4.5V

## Measurement (No Load)
Measured Vin: 9V  
Measured Vout: 4.5 V  

## Load Test
Load resistor connected:10kΩ  
Measured Vout with load: 4.3 V  

## Observation
When a load is connected, the output voltage drops because the load is in parallel with R2.

## Conclusion
A voltage divider is suitable for voltage sensing but not for powering loads.
