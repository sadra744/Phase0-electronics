# Phase 0 – Electronics Fundamentals

This repository contains my basic electronics experiments.
The goal of this phase is to strengthen my understanding of:
- Ohm's Law
- Voltage divider
- Diodes and LEDs
- RC circuits

Each folder contains:
- A photo of the circuit
- A short explanation
- Measured values and observations
